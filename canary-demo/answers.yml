# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: Prometeus does not have the version number of the app, I dont know why. The commmand is not http_requests_total, its prometheus_http_requests_total #TODO: List any unexpected behaviors you observed
  suggested_improvements: None related to this exercise #TODO: List any improvements you would suggest
